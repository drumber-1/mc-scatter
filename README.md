==========

Simple Monte Carlo scatter light code

mc-scatter can be compiled for different problems using:

./compile <problem>

where <problem> is the name of the directory (within the problems directory) containing the prob.cpp and prob.h files you wish to compile.

Coordinates
-----------

mc-scatter uses often refers to the angles theta and phi.

theta is the angle away from positive x in the x-y plane.
phi is the angle out of the x-y. phi = pi/2 points in the positive z direction, phi = -pi/2 points in the negative x direction
